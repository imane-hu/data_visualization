# Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of Pandas and Plotly Express libraries for data visualization of three different datasets: <br>country_wise_latest.csv, day_wise.csv, and worldometer_data.csv.

Dependencies<br>
This notebook requires the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
plotly.express: For interactive data visualization.<br>

To install these dependencies, you can use pip:<br>
pip install pandas plotly

Files<br>
This repository contains the following files:

data_visualization.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code to visualize the three datasets.<br>
country_wise_latest.csv: Dataset containing the latest COVID-19 data for each country.<br>
day_wise.csv: Dataset containing the COVID-19 data for each day.<br>
worldometer_data.csv: Dataset containing various data for each country.<br>
README.md: This file, describing the contents of the repository.<br>

Usage<br>
To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, simply open the data_visualization.ipynb notebook and run each cell in order.<br>

Results<br>
The notebook produces interactive visualizations for each dataset, which can be used to explore the data and gain insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and other related data. The visualizations include bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, and choropleth maps.
